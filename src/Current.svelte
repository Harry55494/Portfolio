<h2 style="margin-top: 100px;">What I'm currently working on</h2>
<p>
    As well as my third year final project at University (an AI for the board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan">Settlers of Catan</a>), I am currently
    working on my web development skills by using the framework <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> to create this Portfolio Website. I'm also learning
    more about Kubernetes and Docker, and how to use them to deploy web applications. <br><br>
    As well as Web development, I'm also constantly working on my Python and Java skills, including making a TFL Tube
    Status Tracker in Java, and various scripts and programs in Python. <br>
