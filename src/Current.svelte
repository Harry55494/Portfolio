<h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>
<p>
    Currently, I'm spending most of my time on 'Galahad', an algorithmic trading program, which is the reincarnation of Jefferson-IE (previously mentioned here).
    Galahad is designed to be more flexible, and use more modern technologies, such as Docker and Cloudflare R2 Storage. More updates on this soon.
     <br><br>

    I've recently finished my third year CS degree project, which is an AI for the board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan">Settlers of Catan</a>.
    This involved implementing different strategies for a range of AI players, and comparing which ones work the best.
    If you want to see the project, or read the full report, checkout the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> section below.
